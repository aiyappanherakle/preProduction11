            For all items $1,000 and over, GreatCollections is pleased to offer extended payment terms.  Please advise us at least 24 hours before you plan on bidding or purchasing the item that you plan on using the GreatCollections Extended Payment Terms for pre-approval.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Key terms:</strong>
            <Br />
            1.  Extended Payment Terms are not available for bullion items.
           <br />
            2.  A 25% down payment is due within seven days of purchase date.
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional 25% payment due within 30 days of purchase date.
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional 25% payment due within 60 days of purchase date.
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balance due within 90 days of purchase date.
            <br />
            3.  Interest is due on the outstanding balance after 30 days, at the rate of 1% per month (12% annually).  Note, for the first 30 days, no interest is calculated.
            <br />
            4.  There is no penalty for paying off early (and obviously this will save you on interest charges).
           <br />
            5.  GreatCollections will maintain possession of the items until they are paid in full.

            2.
